#PROJECT TITLE
# Reinforcement-learning-based-stock-trading-system

## Overview
This project implements a stock trading system leveraging *Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically **Q-learning*, to optimize trading strategies. The system dynamically adapts to market conditions, leveraging historical price data and machine learning techniques to make data-driven trading decisions, maximizing returns while mitigating risks.

### Key Features:
- *Reinforcement Learning Integration*: Utilized Q-learning to develop a robust, adaptable trading strategy.
- *Data-Driven Decision Making*: Enabled systematic trading decisions based on market data and trends.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Insights generated through interactive dashboards and statistical analysis.
- *Feature Engineering*: Enhanced the model by incorporating technical indicators like MACD, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.
